In recent years, the TSE has witnessed significant volatility, which has impacted the investment decisions of both individual and institutional investors. Volatility refers to the magnitude of fluctuation in stock prices, which can be measured using statistical models such as GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity). GARCH models have been widely used for modeling and forecasting financial time series data, including stock prices. However, the accuracy of forecasting using GARCH models can be improved by integrating machine learning techniques, which are capable of capturing complex relationships and patterns in the data. One such technique is stacking machine learning models, which combine several machine learning algorithms to minimize errors and increase accuracy. Therefore, the proposed research aims to develop a hybrid GARCH and stacking machine learning model to forecast the volatility of the Tehran Stock Exchange. The theoretical framework for this research will be based on the following: 1. Empirical studies on the volatility of the TSE: This will involve reviewing existing literature on the TSE's volatility and identifying the factors that contribute to it. This will provide a basis for developing the research hypotheses and objectives. 2. GARCH models: This will involve a review of the different types of GARCH models and their applications in financial time series forecasting. The research will focus on selecting the appropriate GARCH model that can accurately capture the volatility of the TSE. 3. Machine learning models: This will involve a review of the different machine learning techniques that can be applied to financial time series forecasting, including stacking models. The research will focus on examining the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning models and selecting the most appropriate models for the proposed framework. 4. Hybrid model: This will involve developing the hybrid GARCH and stacking machine learning model for forecasting the volatility of the TSE. The research will test the model using historical data and evaluate its forecasting performance using statistical measures such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). In summary, the proposed research will contribute to the literature on financial forecasting by developing a hybrid GARCH and stacking machine learning model for volatility forecasting of the TSE. This framework will allow investors to make informed investment decisions and reduce the impact of volatility on their portfolios.\", 'user_query': 'i am writing a research proposal with this title “forecasting of Tehran Stock Exchange volatility using hybrid GARCH and stacking machine learning models”. give theoretical framework for this research', 'pii_str': 'tehran'}) (input_keys={'user_query'}): litellm.NotFoundError: NotFoundError: OpenAIException - Resource not found.

Ученые разработали уникальную наноструктуру, способную фильтровать воду от вредных красителей, для создания которой используется материал, традиционно считающийся отходом – использованная целлюлоза. Такие предметы, как тряпки для уборки или бумажные стаканчики, обретают новую жизнь, превращаясь в эффективный фильтр для загрязненной воды. Исследование было опубликовано в престижном журнале Small Science. Органические красители, особенно азосоединения, составляют большую группу синтетических красителей, широко используемых в текстильной промышленности. К сожалению, они часто попадают в сточные воды без предварительной очистки, особенно в странах с низким уровнем экологической ответственности. Эти вещества медленно разлагаются и могут долгое время оставаться в воде, представляя серьезную угрозу для здоровья человека и окружающей среды. Как отмечает профессор Гюнтер Руппрехтер из Института химии материалов TU Wien, само по себе использование материалов, способных адсорбировать такие красители, недостаточно эффективно. Гораздо лучше работает метод, при котором вода пропускается через наноткань, состоящую из мельчайших волокон. Это увеличивает площадь контакта и позволяет связать гораздо больше молекул красителя. Используемый материал, полу-кристаллическая наноцеллюлоза, получают из отходов, предотвращая их ненужную утилизацию. И в отличие от металлосодержащих веществ, применяемых для похожих целей, она абсолютно безопасна для окружающей среды. Технология электропрядения, при которой жидкий материал распыляется, а его капли электрически заряжаются и проходят через электрическое поле, позволяет получать сверхтонкие нити. Так формируется наноткань – наносеть с высокой площадью поверхности. Испытания показали впечатляющие результаты: за три цикла очистки удавалось удалять до 95% красителя из воды. Наносеть можно либо безопасно утилизировать с захваченными вредными веществами, либо регенерировать, очищая от красителей для повторного использования. Несмотря на успех, перед учеными стоят новые задачи – исследовать механические свойства наносети, оценить ее биосовместимость, чувствительность к более сложным загрязнителям и возможности масштабирования производства. Команда профессора Руппрехтера теперь изучает, как технологию фильтрации красителей можно применить в других областях, например, в медицинской индустрии для очистки жидкостей при диализе.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread Using waste to purify water may sound counterintuitive. But at TU Wien, this is exactly what has now been achieved. Researchers have developed a special nanostructure to filter a widespread class of harmful dyes from water. A crucial component is a material that is considered waste: used cellulose, for example in the form of cleaning cloths or paper cups. The cellulose is utilized to coat a fine nano-fabric to create an efficient filter for polluted water. The paper is published in the journal Small Science. Organic dyes represent the largest group of synthetic dyes, including so-called azo compounds. They are widely used in the textile industry, even in countries where little attention is paid to environmental protection, and the dyes often end up in unfiltered wastewater. \"This is dangerous because such dyes degrade very slowly, they can remain in the water for a long time and pose great danger to humans and nature,\" says Prof. Günther Rupprechter from the Institute of Materials Chemistry at TU Wien. There are various materials that can bind such dyes. But that alone is not enough. \"If you simply let the polluted water flow over a filter film that can bind dyes, the cleaning effect is low,\" explains Rupprechter. \"It\\'s much better to create a nanofabric out of lots of tiny fibers and let the water seep through.\" The water then comes into contact with a much larger surface area, and thus many more organic dye molecules can be bound. \"We are working with semi-crystalline nanocellulose, which can be produced from waste material,\" says Qaisar Maqbool, first author of the study and postdoc in Rupprechter\\'s research group. \"Metal-containing substances are often used for similar purposes. Our material, on the other hand, is completely harmless to the environment, and we can also produce it by upcycling waste paper.\" This nano-cellulose is \"spun\" together with the plastic polyacrylonitrile into nanostructures. However, this requires a lot of technical skill. The team from the TU Wien was successful with a so-called electrospinning process. In this process, the material is sprayed in liquid form, the droplets are electrically charged and sent through an electric field. \"This ensures that the liquid forms extremely fine threads with a diameter of 180 to 200 nanometers during curing,\" says Rupprechter. These threads form a fine tissue with a high surface area—a so-called \"nanoweb.\" A network of threads can be placed on one square centimeter, with a total surface area of more than 10 cm2. The tests with these cellulose-coated nanostructures were very successful: In three cycles, water contaminated with violet dye was purified, and 95% of the dye was removed. \"The dyes remain stored in the nanoweb. You can then either dispose of the entire web or regenerate it, dissolve the stored dyes and reuse the filter fabric,\" explains Rupprechter. However, more work needs to be done: evaluating the mechanical properties of the sophisticated nanowebs, conducting biocompatibility tests, assessing sensitivity to more complex pollutants, and achieving scalability to industrial-grade standards. Now Rupprechter and his research team want to investigate how this dye filter technology can be transferred to other areas of application. \"This technology could also be very interesting for the medical field,\" Rupprechter believes. \"Dialysis, for example, also needs filtering out very specific chemical substances from a liquid.\" Coated nanofabrics may be useful for such applications.

Credit Rover is part of a bigger platform called the Insights Platform. It aims to enable efficient market insights through intelligent data aggregation, interactive modules, and configurable alerts. Over time, the Insights platform should expand to support additional applications, especially given the volume of proprietary information we have—which grows every day. RV & Signal RV stands for Relative Value. It is a quantitative analytical approach and is a systematic way to address the fundamental question: what’s expensive and what’s cheap? It allows us to identify relative misvaluations between and among securities, and if they improve the quality of the predictions we make about the future richening and cheapening of these securities. Credit RoVer uses mainly price adjusted OAS to generate relative value signals. The aim is to have one centralized place for all data RV everyone would agree upon. Curve fitting is needed as the starting point for relative value. It allows us to judge which bonds are cheap or rich on an issuer\\'s curve, as well as generate a long history of 5y, 10y, 30y, etc. points to make apples to apples comparisons across issuers for the purpose of relative value. In RoVer, what we effectively try to do is fit thousands of curves automatically and every day. Each issuer or benchmark has a specific curve. Not time efficient to build it out manually for each of them. Curve fitting can be used as an aid for data visualization (term structure), to infer values of a function where no data is available (new issues), and to summarize the relationship among two or more variables (maturity and model OAS). What we effectively do here is generate signals for the desk that help them narrow down potential opportunities to capture alpha. In RoVer, all signals have mean reversion as an underpinning assumption. There are two types of signals, one is spread/standard RV, which focus on CUSIP vs curve signal; the other is regression RV, which illustrates curve vs curve signal. Both signals are generated based on price adjusted OAS. Spread RV looks at distance of latest value of a specific point w.r.t. mean of that same point over a specific window. Each CUSIP has 10 different options of benchmark curves, either issuer curve, or 9 other benchmarks consisting of combination of sector and ratings. This method is typically used on the Bond Selection Page. For example, the graph below looks at AAPL CUSIPs against AAPL issuer curve. The spread to curve (STC) is called the residual. We then take all STC/residuals from AAPL and find their mean. The RV signal/z-score is expressed is expressed in number of standard deviations away from mean. If the latest value is below mean, spread is considered expensive, and the RV signal is negative. If above mean, spread is considered cheap, and the RV signal is positive. Always with mean reversion as a base case. Regression RV look at how the spread of a specific point on a fitted curve compares with the same point on the benchmark curve historically. This method is shown under ‘RV Z Score’ on the Issuer Selection and Forecasting page. Taking AAPL as an example, the spread between the AAPL issuer curve and the Technology A and Above curve is the spread to benchmark (STB). We take all STB and find their mean. If latest point of STB is trading below the mean (negative RV signal), it’s considered expensive (positive RV signal). Conversely, when above the mean it is considered cheap. Both Spread and Regression RV signals have different options of look-back window, meaning the signal is built based on 10 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years of historical data. Back-testing The underpinning assumption of the RV signals is that all signals follow mean reversion. For back-testing, we want to see if the underpinning assumption holds in different regions. We want to evaluate if the spread is moving in the same direction or not as indicated by the RV signal. Let’s assume we choose look-back window of 3 months and expect the mean-reversion happens in 30 days (holding period = 30 days). As shown in the graph below. If the current CUSIP is trading at px adj OAS of 100 bps, while it’s issuer curve (after curve fitting) at the same tenor shows 90 bps of px adj OAS, it means that the CUSIP is currently trading cheap relative to its issuer curve. If the signal of this CUSIP has a RV z-score of 1, which means that this CUSIP is currently trading at 1 stdev above the 3 months historical STC mean. If we hold this CUSIP for 30 days (expect the mean-reversion happens in 30 days), if the RV signal is the right indication, we are expecting it to be mean reverted, which means that the STC should becomes smaller regardless of the CUSIP or the IC moves. At T + 30, both scenarios shown in the graph on the right-hand side follow mean reversion, where we are expecting this CUSIP to become rich. Likewise, the opposite scenario exhibits a divergent dynamic. To perform a thorough back-testing, we tested RV signals with all available look-back periods that the signals are based on, 10 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. We are expecting the signals to be mean reverted, but mean reversion can happen at different time frame. So we look at different holding periods to see how mean reversion occurs, at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months, which can also be extended in the future as needed. In addition, to better understand the performance of RV signals, we performed bucket analysis on RV signals as well as maturities of the bonds. Bin the signals in buckets of (-Inf, -3.0], (-3.0, -2.5], (-2.5, -2.0], …, (2.5, 3.0], (3.0, Inf], and maturity (yrs) in buckets of 0-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-30, 30+. For the back-testing results discussed below, we are testing with 2 years of historical data from 2020-2022. And we breakdown the analysis by currency as well. The results above show the statistics of the residual (STC) movement of CUSIPs in the format of average, median, standard deviation, and P-value. To be more specific, on the far right, we can specify currency, RV signal look-back window, maturity bucket, and historical dates. In this case, we are looking at USD with look-back window of 90 days (3 months). To better understand what the result means, if we look at the upper left cell, where RV z-score bucket is in (3, Inf) with a holding period of 2 weeks, it means that for all bonds in the historical testing data with z-score of 3 and above, on average, residual (STC) tightened 5.79 bps over 2 weeks of holding period. It indicates mean reversion preserves for this specific z-score bucket with this holding period, as positive z-score indicates that the bonds are currently trading cheap (above the mean) and expected to become rich (expensive – smaller px adj oas) over time. From the result, we can see that the monotonical increasing in the residual movements (bps) with the decreasing in the z-score buckets, which indicate overall mean reversion occurs in this scenario. The stronger the signals are, the larger residual movements occurred. A small p-values give stronger support statistically. We also look at how hit rate performs over holding periods by buckets over time. The graph above shows the daily average hit rate of CUSIPs that exhibited residual change in right direction over the holding period. Similarly, we find that the stronger the signals are (more stdev away from the mean), the higher the hit rates are over time. Throughout the back-testing, we’ve found that RV signals strongly follow mean reversion in USD, with different look-back windows and holding periods. The longer the look-back window (2yr) as well as the holding period (6 months), the stronger the signals are. CAD also tends to follow mean reversion, but not as strong as USD. For European and Australian market (EUR, GBP, AUD), mean reversion is minimally from the observation. The main reason is that the bulk of EUR and GBP issuers have very few debts outstanding, and as a result, the curves fitted are less reliable compared with USD. The quant team is working on improving the curve fitting for the next step. Additional highlight on OAS Analysis Apart from back testing the RV signals, we did analysis on OAS in addition to the residual (STC). The reason behind it is that we want to have a better understanding of the market overall. We’ve noticed that the average daily OAS movement is monotonically increasing with the decreasing of RV z-score during 2020-2022. This indicates that rich bonds cheapen more than cheap bonds over time. The yields on rich bonds are increasing at a faster rate than the yields on cheap bonds. This OAS analysis gives us a better understanding of the impact of beta with given period. We have the back-testing results built into the Tableau report, and plan to have it refreshed quarterly to keep track of the behavior of RV signals.

System analysis refers to the study of political systems and their components, such as institutions, actors, and processes, in order to understand how they function and interact with each other. Easton's system analysis framework is based on the idea that political systems can be understood as a set of inputs, conversion processes, and outputs. Inputs refer to the demands, support, and resources that are brought into the political system by various actors and groups. Conversion processes involve the transformation of these inputs into policy decisions and actions by political institutions and actors. Finally, outputs are the outcomes and consequences of these policy decisions and actions. According to Easton, system analysis helps in understanding the functioning of political systems by focusing on the interrelationships between different components and the ways in which they contribute to the overall stability and effectiveness of the system. He also emphasized the role of feedback mechanisms in maintaining the equilibrium of political systems. Easton's system analysis has been widely applied in the study of various political phenomena, such as policy-making, decision-making processes, and the role of different actors in the political system. It has provided a useful framework for analyzing the complex and dynamic nature of political systems and has helped in identifying the factors that shape political outcomes. Overall, David Easton's system analysis has made significant contributions to the field of political science by providing a systematic approach to understanding political systems and their functioning.

Whether you're looking to purchase a new home or sell your property, understanding the latest trends is crucial. Buyers and sellers need to be aware of what's happening around them to make informed decisions and to harness the potential of the market effectively. For sellers, one trend that has been noticeable is the go-digital approach. Gone are the days when the only way to market your home was through traditional methods like print ads and open houses. Now, sellers are utilizing online platforms, showcasing virtual tours, and even using social media to reach potential buyers. Staging a home properly, making necessary renovations, and being flexible with showing times can also impact the selling process positively. On the buyer's side, there's been a noticeable shift towards seeking more sustainable and technology-equipped homes. Energy efficiency, smart home features, and green spaces are becoming highly desirable qualities. Buyers are now more educated and have a plethora of online tools at their disposal to help them make smarter decisions. They are able to research neighborhoods, compare prices, and even get pre-approved for mortgages before setting foot inside a home. Local real estate agents play a pivotal role in both the buying and selling process. They're not just facilitators but trusted advisors who can offer a nuanced understanding of the market, negotiate deals and provide insights that are not readily available through online sources. Their expertise can be particularly invaluable when it comes to navigating through complex transactions or understanding the legal aspects of real estate. The traditional home-buying season starts in spring, but there's been a shift with markets staying active year-round, thanks to the virtual tools enabling property visits anytime, anywhere. This accessibility has created a more constant flow of property listings and sales. Besides, with more companies embracing remote work policies, buyers are no longer tethered to a specific location and can choose to live further away from their workplaces, potentially getting more value for their money. Mortgage rates are another critical factor for the buyer and seller market. Lower rates can incentivize buyers to take the leap and also result in a seller's market, where there are more buyers than available homes, which can drive up housing prices. Conversely, when rates are high, the market may cool down, prices can stabilize or decrease, and this might turn into a buyer's market. Current trends point toward both challenges and opportunities in the New York real estate market. A new home for sale in New York continues to have significant appeal for a variety of reasons—its vibrant culture, robust economy, and the prestige of owning property in one of the world's most renowned cities. However, given the density and demand of the area, the competition is fierce, and prices remain relatively high. Therefore, whether you're buying or selling in New York, an understanding of localized conditions and market nuances is imperative. For sellers in New York, understanding the target demographic is key. Are your potential buyers looking for family-friendly neighborhoods, or are they young professionals looking for a vibrant nightlife and proximity to work? Tailoring your selling strategy to the audience that is most likely to be interested in your property can go a long way. Buyers in New York should be prepared for a potentially fast-paced and competitive market. They might have to act quickly when they find the right new home for sale and should have their financial arrangements in order. They should also be open to exploring different neighborhoods they might not have initially considered to find better value or a growing community that could bring a good return on investment in the future. As real estate buyer and seller trends continue to evolve, both parties must stay informed, adapt their strategies, and seek professional advice when necessary. Whether you're buying your first home, seeking to upgrade, or looking to sell, the real estate market offers a wealth of opportunities for those who are ready to navigate it. In conclusion, the real estate industry is ever-changing, with trends that fluctuate based on economic, technological, and societal shifts. Both buyers and sellers need to stay agile, informed, and, if possible, seek the guidance of local real estate experts to navigate these waters. Understanding the current trends and preparing for them can help ensure a smoother and more successful real estate transaction. Whether it's selling a picturesque home in a bustling New York neighborhood or buying the home of your dreams in this iconic city, the right insights and actions can make all the difference in this significant life milestone.\", 'user_query': 'Need 1000 wrds unqiue blog simple eng on keywrd real estate buyer seller trend use keywrds 1 tym each in contnet nit im tiyle - local real estate agents - new home for sale new york', 'pii_str': 'new'}) (input_keys={'user_query'}): litellm.NotFoundError: NotFoundError: OpenAIException - Resource not found.

His posture should suggest ease, perhaps one leg crossed over the other, or an arm draped over the back of the chair. This relaxed posture is key to making the image feel natural. He’s wearing a black shirt, sneakers, a black cricket cap worn forwards or slightly tilted, and sunglasses, all of which suggest a stylish yet laid-back demeanor. 2. **Wingback Chair**: The chair is classic and should have a somewhat imposing look to add gravitas to the scene. To enhance the 3D effect, the chair should be detailed, with emphasis on the textures (such as leather or fabric). 3. **Angel Wings**: To incorporate the concept of angel wings, they should appear to emanate naturally from the boy\\'s back, blending seamlessly. The wings should be large and detailed, perhaps with a slight transparency to them to make them appear ethereal. They should be positioned in a way that looks as if they are unfurling or at rest but ready for flight, which adds a dynamic element to the image. 4. **Backdrop**: \"NAWABZADA ARSAL\" should be clearly visible in bold, capitalized white fonts on a black wall behind the chair. The font style could be something modern and slightly edgy, to match the boy’s attire. Importantly, the text should have some depth or a slight 3D effect to it, ensuring it doesn\\'t just look flat against the wall but part of the scene. 5. **Lighting**: Since there\\'s no shadow, which would usually add depth, carefully consider the lighting to avoid making the scene feel flat. The lighting should highlight the contours of the boy, the chair, and especially the wings, perhaps with a soft backlight effect on the wings to enhance their ethereal quality. 6. **Perspective and Depth**: Use perspective to enhance the 3D illusion. The boy and the chair should be the focus, with a slight depth of field effect making the background text appear slightly blurred, as if it’s indeed on a wall some distance behind. ### Creating the Illusion: - **Software Choices**: For actual creation, software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator is perfect for layering these elements and adjusting the lighting and shadows (or lack thereof, in this case) to create depth. 3D modeling software, such as Blender, could be used to model the chair, wings, and lettering to make them look more realistic. - **3D Modeling**: If opting to go fully 3D, every element from the boy to the backdrop can be modeled in 3D software. This allows for precise control over lighting, textures, and the overall composition. The wings can be given a translucent quality, and the lettering on the wall can be made to protrude slightly, casting subtle shadows or reflecting light to enhance the 3D effect. Remember, whether working with a graphic designer or undertaking this project yourself, start with a sketch outlining the layout, posture of the boy, position of the wings, and perspective of the lettering. This serves as a blueprint and ensures all elements harmonize to create the desired 3D illusion. If this is a personal project and you\\'re unfamiliar with advanced graphic design or 3D modeling, consider starting with photo editing software to manipulate existing images. Plenty of tutorials are available online to guide you through processes tailored to various skill levels.', 'user_query': 'Create a 3D illusion for a WhatsApp profile picture where a boy in a black shirt sits casually on a Wingback Chair.
